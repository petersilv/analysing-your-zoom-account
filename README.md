## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this repository in full you will need:

- a Zoom account (on a Pro or higher plan)
- Alteryx (version 2019.2+)
- Tableau (version 2019.2+)

Alteryx is a must have. We will use Alteryx to make the GET requests from the Zoom API and process the data.

Tableau is used to provide a sample analysis dashboard of the data downloaded from Zoom so if you want to use the data in a different way then Tableau is not strictly necessary.

A lot of the Zoom API endpoints require at least a Pro plan (particularly the Report endpoints that we utilise) so while you can use some of the macros with a Free account you will miss out on some of the more detailed data sets.
